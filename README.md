# Path_In_Binary_Tree
A "path" starts at any vertex, ends at any vertex, on the condition that no nodes are visited more than once. Unlike graph data structure where we can travel back and forth between nodes, there are no way to go "back" in tree, from child node to parent node.

Therefore following problems may very confused, and need additional attention and condition to handles:

+ Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II
+ Longest Univalue Path
+ Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Let take a look closer to these problems.
